Overview

This app aims to help the homeless and those in need of food and supply. It acts as a bridge between those with excess and those in need of food and other basic supplies for livelihood. If you spot a homeless person on the roads, post the location and a small description. A person with excess food can look at these posts to find people to donate their food. The app is implemented using Flutter and Firebase. Flutter apps can be deployed in both iOS and Android platforms. This increases the user base as it makes the app accessible to all. This is a community driven app and relies on its users for its outreach. 

Goals

To spot and bring the helping hands to the countless homeless and people in dire need of help scattered around the city.
To expand the scope of helping people to a much greater extent. 
Encourage and give people an opportunity to be a part of the process in helping those needy people.

Specifications

Our app works based on user community inputs and gives an opportunity to every person to do the best they can to help the needy people who are barely surviving.
Our app uses GPS location to tag the current location of the help needed with a user given description can allow other people with the ability of helping an opportunity to help someone who is in dire need of help.
We have designed the app and the idea in such a way that it has immense future capabilities of scaling up. The possible scaling includes:
Insights of index of needy people per area, which can be a very useful resource of data for the city planners and city corporation.
NGOs leverage this platform to increase and expand their community and humanitarian services.
